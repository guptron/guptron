		web development is very common in these day you can found so many way to create your own website<br/>
		 bit of information. These cells are rarely read or written individually. Instead, they are handleding roups of ﬁxed size called words. The memory is organized so that one word can be stored or retrieved in one basic operation. The number of bits in each word is referred to as the word length of the computer, typically 16, 32, or 64 bits. To provide easy access to any word in the memory, a distinct address is associated with each word location. Addresses are consecutive numbers, starting from 0, that identify successive locations. Aparticular word is accessed by specifying its address and issuing a control command to the memory that starts the storage or retrieval process. Instructions and data can be written into or read from the memory under the control of theprocessor. It isessential tobe able to access any word location in the memory as quickly as possible. Amemory in which any location can be accessed in a short and ﬁxed amount of time after specifying its address is called a random-access memory (RAM). The time required to access one word is called the memory access time. This time is independent of the location of the word being accessed. It typically ranges from a few nanoseconds (ns) to about 100 ns for current RAM units. Cache Memory As an adjunct to the main memory, a smaller, faster RAM unit, called a cache, is used to hold sections of a program that are currently being executed, along with any associated data. The cache is tightly coupled with the processor and is usually contained on the same integrated-circuit chip.</p>
